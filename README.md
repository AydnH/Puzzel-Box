# Puzzel-Box

Forum post: -
- My Project is themed off deep web black markets. Mainly the hacking and illegal market website where often you have to either hack in or be invited (e.g. password entry only). My plan is to create a password system similar to that of an old school virus of not being able to close unless you solve a puzzle. For inspiration of this assignment i have chosen the phenomenon of Cicada 3031 to be incorporated into my web design. and other trends/aspects of various hacking communities.

Journal Entry : -
- I have taken inspiration for my Yama-ichi from Cicada3301 and various hacker communities to create a puzzle box like website. I have a box which is chained shut and locked with a pin code padlock, The goal is for the user to solver a series of questions on the website to progress until you reach the final page and from that page you will be given the code to unlock the box. I wanted this idea to be playful and easy for people to comprehend the fundamental ideas behind hacking and problem solving. In my original idea i wanted to also make the website have a malware aspect where you would be locked into the browser. However I could not make this work and had to scrap that idea. Instead i locked the question/riddle pages behind a password making it so you have to solve each page to progress. 

Extra: -
- After reaading the forum feedback that I got and from other peers in the class I added a chained close lock box to my project to add a physcial attribute.
- I tested all my webpages on multiple people that I work with, are in class with and others that I live with to make sure they are not too difficult to solve.

The aim of this project was to show people that the main appeal to hacking comunities is the game like aspects and problem solving that you have to do. And I believe I was able to capture those aspects successfully and in a playful manner with my final project.
